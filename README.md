This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property'). The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access a nested object property without first confirming the object and property's existence. The solution involves using optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??)
